        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a fifth-year computer science Ph.D. candidate studying information retrieval under <a href="http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/">ChengXiang Zhai</a> as part of the <a href="https://timan.cs.illinois.edu/ir/index.html">TIMAN Group</a> at <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>.</p>
        <p>Prior to this, I graduated from <a href="https://www.vassar.edu/">Vassar College</a> in 2020 with a B.A. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Mathematics.</p>
		<p>Outside of academia, I enjoy playing <a href="https://www.vassarathletics.com/sports/mens-volleyball/roster/kevin-ros/8392">volleyball</a>.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>If you're like me, you're tired of constantly having to manually search for things. This is especially frustrating in settings where the search is redundant with respect to the context. For example,</p>

		<ol>
            <li>During a meeting, someone references a document. Then someone in the meeting needs to manually search to pull up this document and share it with everyone</li>
            <li>While reading a book, you come across a word you don't know. So you need to open your browser and search to define the word.</li>
			<li>During a class, the professor mentions a concept that's a bit confusing. So you try to find some online diagram that explains the concept</li>
			<li>In a conference presentation, the presenter mentions a related work that in unfamiliar to you. So you pull up the paper being presented, find the title, search for it online, and then skim the discovered paper. </li>

        </ol>

		<p>I'd like to create a world where this information is provided automatically, so that you don't need to spend the time looking for it yourself. Towards this goal, we've built <a href="https://www.instinfo.com/">instinfo</a>, as the first step towards practically addressing these challenges.</p>

		<p>Concretely, this research leverages state-of-the-art language models, machine learning, data collection, benchmark and dataset creation, and user studies.</p>
